## Running the website

To set up our website, run the following in your terminal. You'll need to have Ruby installed (it's pre-installed on macOS and most Linux distributions.)

```
git clone https://github.com/jmfly/hackemtu-data-catalog.git
cd hackemtu-data-catalog
sudo gem install bundler
bundle install
```

To run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Or, as a shortcut, just do `chmod +x run.sh` once, then run

```
./run.sh
```

Anytime you want to start the app.
